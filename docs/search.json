Three years earlier, I had started as a mentee in FUERTE, where I began to learn what it meant to be an ecologist. On Catalina, I wanted to share what I had learned—but at first, I was only showing what I thought a “classical” ecologist should be, not the ecologist I am. A mistake I later corrected by sharing my love for the ocean and all things creepy and crawly."

    "text": "There’s something in the water.\nI begged to be on the Catalina trip for two years. But when I finally hopped off our boat and onto the island, a bolt of electricity shot up my spine. And what I thought was excitement curdled into fear.\nMy journey to Catalina started three years earlier with FUERTE (Field-based Undergraduate Engagement through Research, Teaching, and Education), a program at UC Santa Barbara that supports underrepresented students in fieldwork and research. As part of the first cohort of fellows, FUERTE showed me the magic in science and the value of investing in students. Now, I wanted to give back to FUERTE, and Catalina was the perfect place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll photos were taken by the talented Matt Perko\n\nIn early spring of 2025, FUERTE sent me and five other mentors to Catalina with thirty budding ecology students and one objective: to introduce our students to ecology through mock experiments, snorkeling and hikes. I was terrified. But why? This was supposed to be the moment. The lytic stage of my metamorphosis from mentee to mentor when I spread my wings as a bonafide ecologist. Only, I didn’t feel like an ecologist. But that wasn’t going to stop me from trying to be one.\nOur first activity was tide pooling. As we hiked down, I began to sweat. What is an ecologist, really? Most of the ecologists I knew were like the Moon: old, white, and almost alien. But those celestial bodies had trained me for years, and I know how they think. If I wanted to be an ecologist, I had to think like them. I had to be them. My group started out strong, estimating percent cover and cataloging every barnacle, while I regurgitated case studies. For a moment, I thought this could actually work. But midway through Connell’s theories of interspecific competition, I heard the dreaded sound: a yawn. Then, a student wiped at their watering eyes–tears of joy, no doubt. I turned the students loose to explore the tide pools–or nap.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next morning, I woke up early and hiked to the cove where our group would be snorkeling. Conditions were perfect: water clarity was 40 feet, swell and wind were calm; it would be like snorkeling in an aquarium. Sitting on the beach, I replayed yesterday’s tidepooling trouble. I imitated the “best” ecologists I knew, and nearly bored us all to death. That’s not how I wanted my group to see marine ecology. I wanted them to see it the way I do.\n\n\n\n\n\nI became a marine ecologist because, to me, there’s a certain magic in water. It’s difficult to explain, but it catalyzes a reaction within my bones. There’s something inherently special in understanding and sharing our ocean. And at my core, I just love to be in the water and look at critters. I wanted to share that feeling and that magic with my group.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we swam out to the reef, I spotted it. About twenty feet below, two delicate claws peeked from outside a boulder. It was a Sheep Crab, and one of the biggest ones I had ever seen. As I wrestled the beast from its den, the commotion drew my group in closer. When I surfaced, I could see the gears turning in their heads turning as they confronted this familiar, yet alien creature.“What is that?”, “How old is it?”, “Where does it live?”, “What does it eat?”, “Can we eat it?” All of these questions were, essentially, ecological questions. But even better, they were their questions. As I began to tell the ecological story behind this crab, I thought back to one of my own questions: what is an ecologist, really? I’m sure it’s different for everyone, but, to me, an ecologist is just someone who likes to look at critters and is willing to ask questions about them—and probably someone who’s willing to wrestle a crab 20 feet underwater.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the intertidal, I treated my group like we were in a lecture hall, believing that rigor made my words valuable. Inundating my group with facts and case studies only drowned their curiosity. When I stopped forcing ecology and showed them what excites me about nature, they had space to ask their own questions. Being in the water gave us the opportunity to build a conversation around science and the ocean that fundamentally changed my view of ecology and my place within it. If that isn’t magic, I don’t know what is."

I worked with BREN Master’s Group Debris Free Seas and the non-profit Ocean Defenders Alliance (ODA) to analyze debris data and communicate about removal methods.

    "text": "Kelp forests are one of the most productive marine ecosystems and provide economic, cultural, and conservation value to millions of people. Increased ocean temperatures, greater storm intensity, and other anthropogenic stressors threaten our kelp forests and the value they give to us. Our project applies a functional approach to predict ecosystem function and changes of diversity as a tool for managers and researchers to protect these vital ecosystems. In conjunction with PhD candidate An Bui, I designed generalized linear models to track how functional traits of understory macroalgae change through time and through the process of herbarium preservation.\n\n\nGiant kelp forests provide critical habitat and nutrients to many species (Dayton 1985, Reed et al. 2016), including those of conservation and cultural interest like giant sea bass (Stereolepis gigas), California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus), and abalone (Haliotis spp.). However, due to changing climate regimes, these ecosystems are under threat from increased storm frequency and warming oceans. To protect these crucial ecosystems, we need to understand how each component, or species, works: by identifying key species and how they contribute to the ecosystem, we have the potential to link smaller pieces to a larger picture of ecosystem function.\nOne promising link between species and ecosystem function are functional traits, which are morphological, physiological, or behavioral characteristics of a species that influences its fitness, distribution, and niche (Violle et al. 2007). In contrast, ecosystem functions are broadly defined as processes that identify where and how materials like biomass and nutrients move through ecosystems (reviewed in Forbes et al. 2019). Importantly, functional traits are the mechanism through which species contribute to ecosystem function (Lavorel and Garnier 2012). Functional trait approaches tying species to ecosystems have allowed researchers to make recommendations for ecosystem restoration (Carlucci et al. 2020) and predict changes to diversity in the face of global change (Brandl et al. 2019).\nIn addition to linking species to ecosystem function, functional traits also change through time: understanding the degree to which they change through time is crucial to understanding how ecosystem function may change in the future. Herbaria are emerging as major sources of trait data to connect species to ecosystem function in the face of climate change (Meineke, Hebeling 2021). Herbarium specimens are dried, preserved snapshots of organisms, reflecting environmental conditions at a particular moment in time (Meineke). Measuring functional traits of herbarium specimens can reveal changes through time in response to changing climate conditions: for macroalgae, herbarium-derived trait measurement has revealed shifts in stable isotope concentrations to historical oceanographic conditions (Miller et al. 2018). However, since preserved specimens are dried and shrunken compared to their original forms (Blonder et al. 2012), using herbarium-derived trait measurements of morphological characteristics in particular requires validation of functional traits measured from preserved specimens with fresh specimens (Hebeling 2021). By integrating functional trait data derived from herbarium specimens with data collected in current conditions, we can better understand changes in functional traits through time, providing an opportunity to link species to ecosystem function in the face of a changing climate.\n\n\n\nWe designed species and treatment specific generalized linear models to predict functional trait values through time and preservation. Many models were highly predictive of functional traits, but this relationship varied by the functional trait tested, preservation treatment, and species. Most models follow this general formula: original trait ~ treatment trait * species + 1|individual"

    "text": "Background: Fish are friends!\n\nSome scientists think that your grandchildren may never see a natural coral reef (Hoegh-Guldberg 2019). Corals are in global decline, and climate change is throwing new stressors at our corals faster than they can adapt. One of these new stressors and an emerging source of coral mortality is wounding (Bright 2015). This refers to the physical breakdown of coral tissue and skeleton, which can be caused by a variety of sources from a carelessly placed anchor to an abandoned fishing net. Yet, the most devastating and prevalent source of coral wounds is from predators.\n\n\n\nCrown of Thorns Seastar (Acanthaster planci) is a deadly coral predator, consuming 10 meters2 of coral year-1\n\n\nWounds are deadly to corals because they strain a coral’s physiological machinery. Wounds have been shown to decrease a coral’s ability to grow, reproduce, and photosynthesize (Munk 2024).When wounding intensity is high, corals may not have the energy to heal a wound or deal with the strain associated with the damage. Ultimately, this results in an individual’s death. Predation pressure and wounding is only predicted to increase with climate change, resulting in a future where predators may kill entire reefs.\nLuckily, corals have some pretty good friends in the fight against climate change and wounding. Fish, particularly those who use corals as shelter, have been shown to alleviate strain on a coral’s physiological machinery(Shantz 2023). Fish have been shown to increase a coral’s ability to grow, reproduce, and photosynthesize. Fish help corals make more energy by providing nutrients through excretion and increasing the waterflow around the coral(Shantz 2023).\n\n\n\nYellowtail Dascyllus (Dascyllus flavicaudus) sheltering among the coral Pocillopora sp.\n\n\nOur experiment is interested in elucidating how coral health changes as a function of wounding intensity and fish presence. We studied this relationship in a tank experiment. We collected 72 Pocillopora sp. corals and gave them either no, small, or a large wound. We then spread equal numbers of each wounding treatment into six tanks (12 corals/tank). Thirty grams of the coral sheltering fish, the Yellowtail Dascyllus (Dascyllus flavicaudus) was added to half of these tanks, creating six unique treatments. Corals were housed in treatment tanks for five weeks, and all physiological data was collected at the end.\n\n\n\nExperimental Design: Six tanks, three with fish, three without. All tanks with 4 corals without wounds, 4 corals with a small wound, and 4 corals with a large wound. N=72"

    "text": "Boating and fishing are some of the most popular ways that people enjoy their local waterways. Unfortunately, unsafe habits like littering and dumping while on the water can drastically weaken an ecosystem’s health. It is estimated that over 100 million marine animals will die this year due to pollution alone. Practicing safe boating and fishing habits can help mitigate the effects of pollution and help your waterways thrive for many years.\nAs a boater, one of the most common environmental impacts is chemical pollution. Common boat soaps and boat paints contain toxic chemicals such as cuprous oxide, which is a known biocide. Cuprous oxide pollution can result in a deadly fog of chemicals that drifts through the water column, resulting in die offs of organisms such as aquatic plants and native fish species. By cleaning your boat on land and using products without cuprous oxide, you can help mitigate the loss of marine life and keep your waterway healthy. Also, another way to mitigate your chemical impact is by getting your boat checked by the U.S. Coast Guard. The U.S. Coast Guard offers free boat inspections and educational courses to make sure that your boat meets the necessary safety and environmental standards within your state. This includes checking for any fuel or chemical leaks that may be present. By adopting healthy boating practices, you can protect the health of your waterway for many years to come.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with boating, unhealthy fishing habits can negatively impact your waterways. As of 2018, there is an estimated 79,000 metric tons of plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, with 46% being composed of discarded fishing nets alone. One of the main culprits of fishing pollution is discarded fishing line. A good tip for your next fishing trip is to take a reusable bag and use it as your designated line receptacle while you are out. The most common fishing line pollution is small bits of tag line that are cut from fishing knots. It may not seem like a lot, but those small pieces can add up by the end of the day. In addition, a healthy habit is to recycle your unwanted fishing line. Many bodies of water have fishing line recycling receptacles available for you. If none are available to you, you can still recycle by mailing your fishing line to a nearby fishing line recycling plant. Last year alone, the Boat U.S. Foundation’s Reel In and Recycle Program collected enough fishing lines from their recycling containers to stretch from Washington D.C. to San Diego, CA. By practicing healthy fishing habits, you can help minimize your contribution to global pollution.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s important to understand that what we do on the water has impacts on not only the environment but also the people around us. By practicing safer boating and fishing habits, we can minimize our impacts on the environment and ensure the longevity of the natural resources we enjoy"

My paper is an extension of a project called Past, Present, Predictions: functional approaches to link species to ecosystem function.It builds off the PhD thesis of one of my mentors and another data science icon, An Bui. My project explores the idea that we can leverage the large collections of seaweeds that are preserved by museums and universities into long-term data about kelp forests. Many museums and universities have collections of seaweeds that span hundreds of specimens, species, and even years. These collections are used to studying the anatomy of seaweeds, but my project aims to study how these seaweeds functioned within their kelp forest. We can get data about a seaweed’s function by measuring its characteristics like height, width, volume, or thickness. Measurements like these are called functional traits and they can give us clues as to how a seaweed contributed to kelp forest functions/characteristics such as photosynthetic rates, wave reduction, and overall mass of seaweed.\n\n\n\nA diagram showing how height and width (common functional traits) are measured on a simulated seaweed specimen\n\n\nWhat’s unique about preserved seaweed is that they are a snapshot in time, and we can use them as a window to the past of kelp forest function. Using preserved seaweed, we can observe how a kelp forest functioned at a point in time that predates any data we currently have. This is important because we can use our understanding of the past to predict how kelp forests will function in an uncertain future. But using preserved seaweed also presents a unique challenge when using functional traits.\n\n\n\nOne of the oldest pressed seaweeds at the UCSB Herbarium. Collected in 1902 by Mary S. Snyder, this specimen is over one hundred years old!\n\n\nUniversities and museums preserve seaweed by flattening specimens and slowly drying them out. During the process, the seaweeds shrink. This poses a challenge to a functional trait approach because our measurements are now biased by the preservation process. A seaweed with a height of 16 inches when it was initially collected may measure 8 inches after it is dried. My project seeks to overcome this bias by creating models that use the functional traits of a preserved seaweed to predict the functional traits of that same seaweed before it was preserved. And I will be visualizing these models in my plots below!"

    "text": "The plot thickens\nI started this process with two concrete goals for my visualizations: to show that our models vary by trait and to show that our models vary by species. But as I learned and thought more about the purpose of data visualization, I added a third goal: tell a story.\n\n\n\nAn example of an early visualization showing all the different models for each treatment. Note that this plot is hard to read and lacks structure and a clear message\n\n\nI wanted to show linear models, so I started with a line graph, just two axis and a line. This was perfect for showing the models, but there wasn’t a story there. So I turned to embellishments like titles, labels, colors, and typography to add some narrative to my plots. I had an easy time creating titles and labels because I understood their purpose within a narrative. I had a harder time with elements like color and typography. I never even considered them as elements of a story. Even from a purely aesthetic perspective, I didn’t understand them well. I realized I had been neglecting these components not only in my data visualizations, but also in my everyday life. This exercise in data visualization soon became an exercise in intentional design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWhen thinking about the design of my plots, I started with the titles and subtitles. My goal was that they would give the reader the main takeaways from the plot. Data visualization is a complex language in itself. Putting my main takeaways in the titles helps the reader walk away with the main idea without even having to decipher the plot. As a result, my titles are broad and say something about the nature of the relationships shown (vary by species or follow a 1:1 line). Further specificity is available for readers in the plot. There I targeted multiple visual hierarchies to help the reader interpret the data from different angles, and I used embellishments like color and drawings to give the readers access to further complexity. Basic themes were used to minimize non-data ink and to draw attention to just the data being shown. An example where these elements were incorporated is in the shrinkage plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this plot, the main takeaway is that the preservation process changes each species differently, suggesting that some models may need to be species-dependent. Here, each species is labeled and readers can determine the percent shrinkage by using the number line or by comparing the difference in area between the shaded regions in the drawing of the seaweed. For each species, the larger outline represents the size of a seaweed when it is initially collected, and the smaller, colored outline represents the algae after it has been dried, scaled down to its measured percent decrease. In this plot, I played around with the idea that color could convey complexity, and each color of the seaweeds that are drawn represents the family that the it belongs to (red - Rhodophyta, brown - Phaeophyta, and green - Chlorophyta). I also added in an appealing, professional font, which offers nothing other than a refreshing break from the default R font.\n\nA note about color: One in twenty people has some form of color blindness. To increase accessibility in my visualizations, I used David Nichols’s Coloring for Colorblindness to choose a palette for those who see colors differently. I also used colors from the calecopal palette designed by the amazing An Bui, Heili Lowman, Ana Sofia Guerra, and Ana Miller-ter Kuile"

Most of my experience with data visualization has been with those black and white figures you find in scientific journals; the ones that are either devoid of complexity or packed with so much information that it’s hard to draw anything meaningful from there. By leaning into the artistic side of data visualization, we can tell whole stories with a few lines of code and some thoughtful design. I’ve always liked the intersection of art and science. Art speaks to us in a language that requires no translation, and it has the potential to increase access to the subject material. I now see that data science sits at the intersection of art and science. In the future, I hope to lean into the artistic side of data science to help science reach a wider audience."

    "text": "Orange County Coastkeeper’s education and internship programs offer a unique opportunity for students and community members to take action regarding their concerns with water quality and local aquatic habitats. Though this year has been very limited, our committed students have found ways to remain motivated and carry out some real, meaningful work.\nBelow you will find the story of our intern, Hayden Vega’s experience working with Coastkeeper. Hayden is a student at Troy High School in Fullerton, CA.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Hayden:\n“The beast anchored itself in the merciless current, but with one last heave, I wrenched the monster from its stronghold. As my bounty lied at my feet, I realized this was no ordinary fish. More akin to a soggy bedsheet, this faceless blob and its kind can plague our waters for nearly 1,000 years. The bane of all environmentalists: a plastic takeout bag. As a fisherman, I saw myself as partly responsible for this scene, but I also saw an opportunity to solve a problem I was passionate about.\nRecently, I saw that I’ve been catching more red herrings, whether it’s plastic bags or even tangled fishing line. This is especially true at one of my favorite spots: the Seal Beach Fishing Pier. The pier was losing its reputation as a safe space for families as abandoned hooks and tumbleweeds of fishing line became more commonplace.\nAfter some research, the California State Parks city-based fishing line recycling program caught my eye. It was perfect. I wanted to contact Seal Beach officials, so I mixed somber pollution statistics with cliche John Muir quotes into a monstrosity of an email that I sent to the director of public works, Steve Myrter.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin a month, we worked out the major details like location, design, and maintenance of fishing line recycling bins. I was able to create a digital 3D model of CA State Parks’s receptacle design for the program’s future use and worked with city planners to finalize locations for the bins at the pier’s fishing hotspots. Through this experience, I learned that sometimes all it takes to help is to care and speak up. I did, and now my community is cleaner for it.”\nWe are inspired by Hayden’s commitment and hope that we can continue to be the avenue by which our community members can take action."

    "text": "I used to wake up in darkness every day. My parents would wake up earlier. I had to go to school and they had to go to work. The streetlights were still on when my mom drove me to my friend’s house. I would lay on their floor, wrap my arms around my knees, and rifle through flashcards I’d made the night before. The white of the cards was just enough contrast in the dull morning to keep me awake. When I was done with each card, I would tuck it underneath my cheek, and by the time my friend’s mom woke up to drive us to school, I had a makeshift pillow and a terribly sore cheek. This daily ritual was a reminder of how precarious yet important my education was. My parents graduated from high school just a block from our house, but they were adamant that they would wake an hour earlier and drive 30 miles farther so that I could go to a school outside of our district. As the son and daughter of immigrants, my parents believed education was the key to their dreams, just as their parents believed. When they had children, they bore that same belief into me.\nMy parents were hard workers, and I wanted to be a hard worker too. When I went to high school, I decided to carry the weight of my parents’ sacrifices in my book bag and use it to push myself forward, but I never made it as far as my parents wanted me to. My first report card read: GPA 2.5. My parents and I held the assumption that those two numbers reflected my effort, intelligence, and worth: 2.5 out of 5.0. The card said that I was half trying, half as intelligent, and worth half as much as I should be. I pushed harder. Within a year I developed stress-induced rashes, morning nausea, and an eating disorder. It was like my body was rejecting all the pressure I was putting on myself, but I kept going for my family.\nAt least, I would always say that it was for my family, even though I would prioritize school over them. At birthday parties or cook-outs, I would keep flashcards in my pocket so I could study under the table; I was physically present but mentally distanced. When my abuelo got cancer, my dad drove ten hours every weekend to visit him. My sisters and mother would tag along while I stayed home to study. They visited ten times, but I went once, flashcards in my pocket. He died a month later. All I can remember is that I was still holding flashcards in my hand when my parents told me. I can’t remember what the cards said or why I was even holding them, but a decade later, I can still remember my grandfather. I still catch whiffs of his cologne hanging in the air. I still see his crooked smile peeking from underneath his mustache. I still hear him whispering mijo in my ear, and I still regret being selfish. The truth is that I didn’t spend so much time studying just for my family. I did it for me too. I wanted to be better, and I thought that if I tried harder I could prove I was worth more than 2.5-worth everything that my family had sacrificed. I was selfish and scared to disappoint them, so I treated my family like they were less important than my goals and justified it by saying that it was all for them.\nMany years later, I now have the perspective to navigate the distinction between my own pride and my family’s pressure. Still, it’s hard for me to believe that my past self thought flashcards we won’t remember were more important than making new memories with people we’ll never forget. I haven’t touched flashcards since high school, but every time I see them, my fingers itch and my cheek hurts a little – flashcards really do make terrible pillows. That’s why I give flashcards 2.5/5.0 stars."
