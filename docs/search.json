    "text": "This document summarizes the data collected in an experiment comparing the effect of wounding intensity (none, small, large) and fish presence (Dascyllus flavicaudus) on a coral’s (Pocillopora sp.) photosynthetic efficiency. Our results show no significant effect of wounding intensity on photosynthetic efficiency among all treatments and datasets. Our results also show a positive, yet not significant, effect of fish presence on the photosynthetic efficiency of healed tissue among high wound intensity treatments only. Under no and small wounding intensities for all data sets the effect of fish on photosynthetic efficiency was negligible.\nWhen drawing conclusions about our data, it’s important to acknowledge that our data suffers from a small sample size. Our experiment contained three intensities of wounding and a binary variable of fish presence, creating six unique combinations of wounding intensity and fish presence. Within each unique combination of treatments n=12. Conclusions about the relationships governing the observed data should be drawn carefully.\nThank you for your time.\n\n\n\nSome scientists think that your grandchildren may never see a natural coral reef(Hoegh-Guldberg 2019). Corals are in global decline, and climate change is throwing new stressors at our corals faster than they can adapt. One of these new stressors and an emerging source of coral mortality is wounding(Bright 2015). This refers to the mechanical breakdown of coral tissue and skeleton, which can be caused by a variety of sources from a carelessly placed anchor to an abandoned fishing net. Yet, the most devastating and prevalent source of coral wounds is from predators.\n\n\n\nCrown of Thorns Seastar (Acanthaster planci) is a deadly coral predator, consuming 10 meters2 of coral year-1\n\n\nWounds are deadly to corals because they strain a coral’s physiological machinery. Wounds have been shown to decrease a coral’s ability to grow, reproduce, and photosynthesize (Munk 2024).When wounding intensity is high, corals may not have the energy to heal a wound or deal with the strain associated with the damage. Ultimately, this results in an individual’s death. Predation pressure and wounding is only predicted to increase with climate change, resulting in a future where predators may kill entire reefs.\nLuckily, corals have some pretty good friends in the fight against climate change and wounding. Fish, particularly those who use corals as shelter, have been shown to alleviate strain on a coral’s physiological machinery(Shantz 2023). Fish have been shown to increase a coral’s ability to grow, reproduce, and photosynthesize.Fish help corals make more energy by providing nutrients through excretion and increasing the waterflow around the coral(Shantz 2023).\n\n\n\nYellowtail Dascyllus (Dascyllus flavicaudus) sheltering among the coral Pocillopora sp.\n\n\nOur experiment is interested in elucidating how coral health changes as a function of wounding intensity and fish presence. We studied this relationship in a tank experiment. We collected 72 Pocillopora sp. corals and gave them either no, small, or a large wound. We then spread equal numbers of each wounding treatment into six tanks (12 corals/tank). Thirty grams of the coral sheltering fish, the Yellowtail Dascyllus (Dascyllus flavicaudus) was added to half of these tanks, creating six unique treatments. Corals were housed in treatment tanks for five weeks, and all physiological data was collected at the end.\n\n\n\nExperimental Design: Six tanks, three with fish, three without. All tanks with 4 corals without wounds, 4 corals with a small wound, and 4 corals with a large wound. N=72\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two datasets described in this document: photosynthetic efficiency of undisturbed tissue and photosynthetic efficiency of healed tissue. Coral is a colonial organism, thus wounding, however localized, could affect the entire colony’s ability to photosynthesize, as well as the ability of the tissue local to the wound. To account for this potential result, we collected data on both undisturbed (whole colony) tissue and tissue that had regrown over the wound (healed tissue). Our guiding questions were, “Is there a significant difference between photosynthetic efficiency among wounding treatments and fish presence?”\nTo address our question, we first qualitatively observed the data to inform our later analysis. Then we used randomized hypothesis testing against a null model to form conclusions about the interaction of wounding intensity and fish presence on photosynthetic efficiency. Specifically testing the hypotheses of whether or not there was a difference in photosynthetic efficiency across and among treatments. For treatments that showed a distinct pattern, we created a generalized linear model to characterize the effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npam_undisturbed_healed <- read_csv(\"pam_undisturbed_healed.csv\")\n\npam_healed <- read_csv(\"pam_healed.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\npam_undisturbed_healed %>% \n  ggplot(aes (x = fish, y = fv_fm, fill = fish)) +\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  theme_bw()\n\n  ## Boxplot of PAM including x = wound and  fish = fill\npam_undisturbed_healed %>% \n  ggplot (aes (x = wound, y = fv_fm, fill = fish))+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  theme_bw()\n\n  ## Boxplot of PAM including x = fish and fill = wound\n\npam_undisturbed_healed %>% \n  ggplot (aes (x = fish, y = fv_fm, fill = wound))+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  theme_bw()\n\npam_undisturbed_healed %>% \n  ggplot (aes (x = wound, y = fv_fm, fill = wound))+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nFig 1.

As a main food-source for many animals, tracking the abundance and diversity of macroinvertebrates can tell us a lot about the health of an ecosystem. In my first-ever research project, I worked with undergraduate students from UCSB’s Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration to catalog the abundance, diversity, and location of macroinvertebrate populations in the Coal Oil Point Reserve. We interpreted these analyses into ecosystem health metrics and presented our findings to restoration managers."

A large source of entanglements comes from fishing industries and results in many fisheries being shut down or delayed. Luckily, many people are trying to resolve conflicts between conservation and fishing interests. I worked with BREN Master’s Group Debris Free Seas and the non-profit Ocean Defenders Alliance (ODA) to analyze debris data and communicate about removal methods. We designed interactive maps of debris hotspots using collection data from ODA and graphs summarizing gear removal by type and quantity. We then used these data analyses and media provided by ODA to synthesize communication materials to inform the public on marine debris and ODA’s mission."

    "text": "Kelp forests are one of the most productive marine ecosystems and provide economic, cultural, and conservation value to millions of people. Increased ocean temperatures, greater storm intensity, and other anthropogenic stressors threaten our kelp forests and the value they give to us. Our project applies a functional approach to predict ecosystem function and changes of diversity as a tool for managers and researchers to protect these vital ecosystems. In conjunction with PhD candidate An Bui, I designed generalized linear models to track how functional traits of understory macroalgae change through time and through the process of herbarium preservation.\n\n\nGiant kelp forests provide critical habitat and nutrients to many species (Dayton 1985, Reed et al. 2016), including those of conservation and cultural interest like giant sea bass (Stereolepis gigas), California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus), and abalone (Haliotis spp.). However, due to changing climate regimes, these ecosystems are under threat from increased storm frequency and warming oceans. To protect these crucial ecosystems, we need to understand how each component, or species, works: by identifying key species and how they contribute to the ecosystem, we have the potential to link smaller pieces to a larger picture of ecosystem function.\nOne promising link between species and ecosystem function are functional traits, which are morphological, physiological, or behavioral characteristics of a species that influences its fitness, distribution, and niche (Violle et al. 2007). In contrast, ecosystem functions are broadly defined as processes that identify where and how materials like biomass and nutrients move through ecosystems (reviewed in Forbes et al. 2019). Importantly, functional traits are the mechanism through which species contribute to ecosystem function (Lavorel and Garnier 2012). Functional trait approaches tying species to ecosystems have allowed researchers to make recommendations for ecosystem restoration (Carlucci et al. 2020) and predict changes to diversity in the face of global change (Brandl et al. 2019).\nIn addition to linking species to ecosystem function, functional traits also change through time: understanding the degree to which they change through time is crucial to understanding how ecosystem function may change in the future. Herbaria are emerging as major sources of trait data to connect species to ecosystem function in the face of climate change (Meineke, Hebeling 2021). Herbarium specimens are dried, preserved snapshots of organisms, reflecting environmental conditions at a particular moment in time (Meineke). Measuring functional traits of herbarium specimens can reveal changes through time in response to changing climate conditions: for macroalgae, herbarium-derived trait measurement has revealed shifts in stable isotope concentrations to historical oceanographic conditions (Miller et al. 2018). However, since preserved specimens are dried and shrunken compared to their original forms (Blonder et al. 2012), using herbarium-derived trait measurements of morphological characteristics in particular requires validation of functional traits measured from preserved specimens with fresh specimens (Hebeling 2021). By integrating functional trait data derived from herbarium specimens with data collected in current conditions, we can better understand changes in functional traits through time, providing an opportunity to link species to ecosystem function in the face of a changing climate.\n\n\n\nWe designed species and treatment specific generalized linear models to predict functional trait values through time and preservation. Many models were highly predictive of functional traits, but this relationship varied by the functional trait tested, preservation treatment, and species. Most models follow this general formula: original trait ~ treatment trait * species + 1|individual"
