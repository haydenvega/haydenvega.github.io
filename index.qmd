Hi, I'm Hayden! I'm a marine scientist interested in leveraging ecology and environmental science to conserve marine systems. Through my work, I hope to connect others to science and our natural world, so I wear many hats as a scientist, writer, artist, teacher, and student. Feel free to browse some of my work and reach out!
