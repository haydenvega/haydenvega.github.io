Hi, I'm Hayden! I'm a marine scientist interested in leveraging marine ecology and environmental science to improve social and environmental systems. Addressing environmental issues is complex, so I wear many hats as a scientist, photographer, writer, artist, teacher, and student. Feel free to browse some of my work and reach out!
