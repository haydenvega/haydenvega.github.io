> **TL;DR**: In early 2025, I traveled to Santa Catalina Island as a mentor for budding ecologists with the [**FUERTE**](https://fuerte.eemb.ucsb.edu/) program. Three years earlier, I had started as a mentee in FUERTE, where I began to learn what it meant to be an ecologist. On Catalina, I wanted to share what I had learned—but at first, I was only showing what I thought a "classical" ecologist should be, not the ecologist I am. A mistake I later corrected by sharing my love for the ocean and all things creepy and crawly.




## There's something in the water.

I had been begging to be on the Catalina trip for two years. But when I finally hopped off our boat and onto the island, a bolt of electricity shot up my spine-and what I thought was excitement curdled into fear. 

My journey to Catalina started three years earlier with FUERTE (Field-based Undergraduate Engagement through Research, Teaching, and Education), a program at UC Santa Barbara that supports underrepresented students in fieldwork and research. As part of the first cohort of fellows, FUERTE showed me the magic in science and the value of investing in students. Now, I wanted to give back to FUERTE, and Catalina was the perfect place.

In early spring of 2025, FUERTE sent me and five other mentors to Catalina with thirty mentees to explore ecological principles through mock experiments, snorkeling and hikes. When I took my first step onto the island, my excitement faded into fear. But why? This was supposed to be *the moment*. The lytic stage of my metamorphosis from mentee to mentor when I spread my wings as a bonafide ecologist. Only, I didn’t feel like a mentor or an ecologist. 

Our first activity was tide pooling. As we hiked down, I began to sweat. What is an ecologist, really? Most of the ecologists I knew were old white men, who seemed to have been born with PhDs. I thought I needed to emulate them. My group started out strong, estimating percent cover and cataloging every barnacle, while I regurgitated case studies. For a moment, I thought this could actually work. But midway through Connell’s theories of interspecific competition, I heard the dreaded sound: a yawn. Then, another student wiped at their watering eyes–tears of joy, no doubt. Five minutes later, I was fighting the Sandman–and losing. Fifteen minutes in, I turned the students loose to explore the tide pools–or nap.

The next morning, I woke up early and hiked to the cove where our group would be snorkeling. Conditions were perfect: visibility was 40 feet, swell and wind were calm; it would be like snorkeling in an aquarium. Sitting on the beach, I replayed yesterday’s tidepooling trouble. I imitated the “best” ecologists I knew, and nearly bored us all to death. That’s not how I wanted my group to see marine ecology. I wanted them to see it the way I do.

I became a marine ecologist because, to me, there’s a certain magic in water. It’s difficult to explain, but it catalyzes a reaction within my bones. There’s something inherently special in understanding and sharing our ocean. At my core, I’m just a guy who likes to be in the water and look at critters. Being in nature is what brightens my day, and I wanted to share that feeling with my group.

As we swam out to the reef, I spotted it. About twenty feet below, two delicate claws peeked from outside a boulder. It was a Sheep Crab, and one of the biggest ones I had ever seen. I wrestled the thick claws away from my hands and the commotion drew my group in closer. I could see the gears turning in their heads as they confronted this familiar, yet alien creature. Soon, they were asking about crab and kelp ecology. “What is that?”, “How old is it?”, “Where does it live?”, “What does it eat?”, “Can we eat it?”, “Can I catch one?”

In the intertidal, I treated my group like we were in a lecture hall, believing that rigor made my words valuable. Inundating my group with facts and case studies only drowned their curiosity. When I stopped forcing ecology and showed them what excites me about nature, they had space to ask their own questions. Being in the water gave us the opportunity to build a conversation around science and the ocean. If that isn’t magical, I don’t know what is.
