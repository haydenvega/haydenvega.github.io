The Seal Beach Fishing Line Recycling Program works with Seal Beach Municipalities, the Seal Beach Police Department, OC Coastkeeper, and the Boat US Foundation to collect and recycle fishing debris in the city of Seal Beach. 

We've recycled over one hundred pounds of fishing debris, but my main goal is to build a community of fishers and activists centered around the protection of our oceans.
