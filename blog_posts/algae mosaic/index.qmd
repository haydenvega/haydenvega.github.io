This exhibit aims to teach visitors about the delicate geometry and diversity of seaweed under our feet and beneath the waves at the Coal Oil Point Nature Reserve. 

This exhibit is composed of three parts; the first is a touch drawer full of preserved seaweed (uniquely designed for this exhibit), a three foot microscope slide to view all the microscopic life seaweed supports, and a collection of labeled seaweed specimens for identification.

This exhibit is under construction and will be available for viewing in June 2025.
