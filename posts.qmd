## 

As a first-gen person of color in STEM, I am passionate about helping people from all backgrounds experience science and the natural world. Outreach is a powerful tool because it makes science accessible. I hope to teach others about the problems our planet faces and the steps toward solutions, but above all, I hope that others are inspired by facts and feelings to appreciate the world around them a little bit more.
