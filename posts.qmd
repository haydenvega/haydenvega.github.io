## 

As a first-gen person of color in STEM, I am passionate about helping people from all backgrounds experience science and the natural world.

Outreach is a powerful tool because it makes science, activism, and nature accessible. I hope to teach others about science, but above all, I hope to use facts and feelings to inspire others to appreciate the world around them a little more.
